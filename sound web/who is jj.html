          <p>Junaid Jamshed (1964-2016) was a Pakistani recording artist, songwriter, and television personality. He rose to fame in the 1980s as the lead vocalist of the Pakistani pop band Vital Signs, which produced several hit songs, including "Dil Dil Pakistan." After the band disbanded in the mid-1990s, Junaid Jamshed turned to Islam and became a religious preacher, delivering sermons and naats (Islamic hymns) that were widely popular in Pakistan and other Muslim countries. He also launched a successful clothing brand that catered to religious consumers, under the name J. or Junaid Jamshed. Junaid Jamshed passed away in a plane crash in 2016, leaving behind a legacy as one of Pakistan's most beloved pop stars turned religious figures.</p><br>
